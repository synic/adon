AVR Simon Clone

This is a simon clone written for AVR, specifically the ATTiny84a.  The schematic board in eagle/ has been designed to run off of 2 AA batteries, and the chip fuses in fuses.txt set the attiny84a to have a clock of 4mhz, and to have a brown out of 1.8 volts, meaning the batteries should last quite a while before they need to be replaced.
